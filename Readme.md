# About
The Pixel Perfect Tiles theme was designed exclusively for the retro handheld console R36S, running AMberELEC (It may work in other specifications but it may need adaptations, I did use it on ArkOS fine but have seen other people report to me that they weren't able to do so).

# Disclaimers
- I cannot give support for this theme, what I did here was modify an existing theme to my liking, create some coding with the basic knowledge of xml that I have, and make things work for how I was interested in. I do not garantee that it will work perfectly for you. I simply changed and adapted the aspects that I wanted. 
- I didn't create icons for every single system supported, but I created/found icons for the major and most popular ones, so most people will be fine with the ones provided. You can always add the ones that are not there yet if you find some in the same style, **I will be adding more with time**.
- Dark mode is not working on ArkOS, I have no idea why YET (as I said, I have basic knowledge and just managed to get my way around it), but I'll keep trying. You're welcome to solve it =) 
- If you have any questions I may not be able to answer them since I am not well versed on creating themes for Emulation Station. I will be happy to try but I can't garantee any solutions =)
- Suggestions, inputs and contributions are appreciated.
